 Responsive Design:
  Media queries:
    Specific way of assigning CSS not to a particular HTML element, but to a
    particular HTML on a particular type of media. So that type of media might
    be particulary-sized computers, or particulary-sized phones, even the
    difference between how you want a website to look when you are writing the
    code for it to appear on a screen versus how you want the website to look if
    someone prints it out, for example on a printer.
